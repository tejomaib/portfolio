      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm looking for an internship that combines software engineering and semiconductor hardware, offering hands-on projects and opportunities for growth. With skills in Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, and React, I've gained experience in both dynamic web development and robust backend systems. I'm excited to tackle real-world challenges and apply my knowledge in a practical setting.</p>
    <p>I’m also passionate about hardware engineering, particularly semiconductor design. My hands-on work with breadboards and circuits has given me a solid foundation in hardware design and deepened my interest in chip design. This practical experience has fueled my enthusiasm for exploring more in this field.</p>
    <p>An ideal internship would provide a mix of software and hardware projects, challenging my problem-solving skills and allowing me to collaborate with experienced professionals. I'm looking for a role in a supportive environment that values creativity and critical thinking. This opportunity would help me refine my skills, build meaningful connections, and grow as a well-rounded engineer ready to tackle the challenges of the tech industry.</p>
